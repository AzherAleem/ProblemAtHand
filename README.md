# ProblemAtHand
This is a code repository for problems related but not limited to algorithms and data structures. 
Use of any programming language to solve a problem is welcome & acceptable.

Try listing the solution in a generalized and systematic way so that it is understandable to others as well.

For example: 

1. Try to give the file an appropriate name which depicts what the problem is related to. e.g. ReverseLinkedList.py
2. Try mentioning the problem statement at start of the solution document.
3. Try mentioning your approach to solve that particular problem in comments.
4. Try to break the problem to code in a modular approach.
5. In a main method write and run for some possible test & edge cases that the problem should work fine on.
6. Try mentioning the Time and space complexity in terms of Big O notation.

Remember to not jump into the problem ASAP! Instead take appropriate time to think on how to approach a problem. Whenever you get stuck try to ATTACK the problem from different ends. Don't forget to handle edge cases and if at first solving with a naive approach try doing it with an optimal solution.

To get started on some common approaches to solve a problem give this a read:
